9. From geometry: Write a computer program that given the lengths of the 
   two sides of a right triangle adjacent to the right angle computes the 
   length of the hypotenuse of the triangle. (See Figure 8.6.) If you 
   are unsure how to solve the problem mathematically, do a web search 
   for the Pythagorean theorem. Use functions from the <cmath> include file.
   
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include <math.h>   
    
int main() {

    double x, y, result;
    std::cin >> x>>y;
    result = hypot (x, y);
    std::cout<<result<<'\n';
}
